# Project8-VGG16-Convolutional-Neural-Network-for-Cat-and-Dog-Recognition
GGNet is a new convolutional neural network presented at ICLR 2015 (International Conference on Learning Representations, 2015) that achieves very high recognition rates on ImageNet and works well on DCNN (Deep Convolutional Network)-based projects, allowing extensive fine-tuning afterwards. VGGNet is a convolutional neural network with more hidden layers (typically 16 or 19 layers) on top of AlexNet, which has about three times more parameters than AlexNet.
